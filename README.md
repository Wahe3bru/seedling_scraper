# seedling_scraper

[Living Seeds](https://livingseeds.co.za) is a local company that sells heirloom seeds and now recently seedlings. They rotate the seedlings often and I thought it would be a perfect project for me as I learn webscraping and automatically get notified when there are new seedlings available.

#### Tech used
I  am using Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium and PhantomJS.

#### Background story
I am still building and preparing my backyard for growing my own vegetables and herbs. I have space in my front yard that I would like to turn into a minture food forest with fruit trees and accompanying beneficial plants (for both man, plants and some welcomed insect guests). I plan to fill the accessible gaps with veggies and herbs. The easiest way would be to plant seedlings. The only problem is that my nearby garden centres have limited range. Living Seeds is the only company that sells seedlings from heirloom seeds so have unique breeds that provide novelty and fun in an otherwise homogenized conformity of the red round tomato and the like.

I want my kids to grow up eating [green zebra tomatoes](https://livingseeds.co.za/green-zebra-tomato.html) and pick a [kaleidoscope](https://livingseeds.co.za/swiss-chard-kaleidoscope.html) of swiss chard and _know that what is on offer is not __only__ what is available_

### The plan
- [x] scrape the seedling page
- [ ] save the data
- [ ] notify if changes to seedling offering
  - [ ] email
  - [ ] telegram bot

optional further development:
- display catalogue of available seedlings currently
- save availability daily for analysis
- - seasonal availability of types
- - price fluctuations
- - comparative analysis
- have telegram bot check availability of certain types and notify with pics
